# /wa-autopilot

`/wa-code` unattended, over batch. Same PM role, same pipeline, one addition: **independent tasks run parallel, each in own git worktree.** Give batch, walk away, read report.

Wording (screen + reports): **wa-board → Voice** — telegraphic, tech terms stay English.

## Scope

Given tasks, or every `todo` task if none (confirm list first if user present). Best on small well-scoped tasks — say so if one look large. Each task enters at its own state — **Entry state** below.

**Args take slugs, display indexes, sprint name or milestone title** (resolution **wa-board → Milestones**), mixed, any order: `/wa-autopilot login-apple`, `/wa-autopilot 2,4,5`, `/wa-autopilot 2-5`, `/wa-autopilot 3 sync-offline`, `/wa-autopilot login-refacto`. Indexes = `#` from wa-board list — resolve per **wa-board → Task indexes**. Always **echo resolved list** (`2 → login-apple`). Bad index → stop, say which, no guess.

**Sprint name expands to its `todo` tasks**, backlog order — `in-progress`, `review`, `validated` already moving or waiting on user, don't touch. Resolve per **wa-board → Sprints**; echo expansion (`login-refacto → login-apple · login-layout · login-errors (3 todo, 2 already in review)`) so user see what left out. Sprint with no todo task → say so, stop. Sprint tasks usually touch same screen, so expect most land in **separate waves** — wave planner doing job, not failure.

## Entry state — any state, from where it stands

Task **named explicitly** (slug, index, `#n`) joins batch whatever its state. Sprint / milestone / no-arg expansion still take only `todo` (GitHub: `grilled`): batch never grabs work waiting on user unless user named it. Every task in batch runs only what's left — never redo done work, never do user's part (retest, close, merge). Echo entry per task in plan: `login-apple: review → validate`.

| State | Autopilot does | Ends |
|---|---|---|
| `todo`, `grilled: false` (GitHub `todo`) | grill unattended (**AFK mode**, *Grill `todo` tickets unattended*; local: `/wa-grill` steps, same `(autopilot assumption)` tagging), then code + validate | `validated` / `review` |
| `todo` grilled (GitHub `grilled`) | code + validate — pipeline below | `validated` / `review` |
| `in-progress` (GitHub `review` + `phase: in-progress`) | resume: worktree on existing task branch, `/wa-code` from first brick not in `## Implementation`, then validate | `validated` / `review` |
| `review` (GitHub `review` draft, `phase: review`) | validate only — worktree on task branch, step 2.3 (tools, verifier, autofix) | `validated` / `review` |
| `validated` (GitHub draft, `phase: validated`) | refresh only — fork point moved → rebase (GitHub: ticket range), build + tests + runtime check; red → validate loop again. Never close: retest + `/wa-close` stay user's | `validated` |
| GitHub `review`, PR ready | keep mergeable — `CONFLICTING` → rebase ticket range, build + tests, push; else nothing | unchanged |
| GitHub `grilling` / `coding` | claimed: `claim` exit 3 → skip, echo owner | — |
| `done` / `canceled` | skip, echo | — |

GitHub: claim before touching, as any round — `grilling` from `todo`, `coding` from `grilled` or `review` (**wa-board → Backlog provider**, *Agent round*). Round ends with nothing to push → `release <n> coding --reset-to review`.

## GitHub provider

`backlog.provider: github` (rules **wa-board → Backlog provider**). Several autopilots, on several machines, may run on one board at once — claims keep them apart.

- **Scope** = unclaimed `grilled` tickets, board order (`wa-backlog list --state grilled`); args = `#n`, indexes, sprint name or milestone title (`list --sprint` / `--milestone`). Expansion never takes `todo` (grilling needs user) — except **AFK mode** (below). Ticket named explicitly → **Entry state**.
- **Claim each ticket before its worktree** — `wa-backlog claim <n> coding`. Exit 3 → drop from batch, echo `#12 skipped: coded by <agent>` (`assigned: true` → `#12 skipped: assigned to @<login>`). Claim just before wave starts, not whole batch up front: later waves' tickets stay free for others until needed. **Post bricks** (`/wa-code` step 1) right after claim, never before: ticket not held = not yours to write on.
- **Also check open PRs** before planning waves: `gh pr list --json number,headRefName,files` — ticket whose BRIEF files overlap files of open PR → warn in plan (`#14 touches LoginView like open PR #9 — merge conflict likely`). Warning, not block.
- **Worktree from existing ticket branch** (grilling pushed it) — fetch, then `git worktree add {worktrees}/<n>-<slug> <branch>`. Never `-b`: spec lives on that branch.
- **Delivery** — end of round per **wa-board → Backlog provider** (*Agent round*, *Draft PR*, *Hooks version gate*): commit (task file `phase: validated` + `## Review` included — `phase: review` when findings stay open, see step 3), push, open PR, then `wa-backlog link-pr <n> <pr>` and — UI in diff — `wa-backlog screenshots <pr> <files>` (**wa-board → Backlog provider**, *Screenshots*). PR per **wa-board → Pull requests** (template, title, labels, assignees). **Validated → ready PR** (no `--draft`; already draft → `gh pr ready <pr>`) + `pr.reviewers` requested, acceptance criteria checklist **checked** (`- [x]`), body line `Validated by autopilot — verifier clean. Test, then merge — or /wa-feedback <n> <notes>.` Criterion only user can prove (agent couldn't run it) → stays `- [ ]`, named in body. **Findings open → draft PR**, boxes unchecked, `Draft — autopilot delivery, verifier findings open. Test, then /wa-feedback · /wa-validate.` No confirm: unattended. Hook moves ticket to `review`, drops claim — nothing sits in `coding` overnight. Stacked base (another ticket's branch forked before upgrade) hits legacy hooks most. Print URL in report card header. Ready PR = user tests, then merges — wiki already synced; `/wa-feedback` turns it back to draft (then `/wa-validate` + `/wa-close` as usual).
- **Handoff** — nothing held after delivery: `/wa-feedback`, `/wa-validate`, `/wa-close` each claim from `review` for their own round, from any worktree or machine. Legacy hooks (`v < 6`) keep autopilot's claim → same host only.
- **Blocked ticket** → `wa-backlog release <n> coding --reset-to grilled --reason "BLOCKED: <question>"` — question lands on issue, ticket free for next attempt once answered.
- **Tracks** (**wa-board → Tracks**, only when `branch.tracks` non-empty) — track tickets run like any, off their trunk. Never move ticket between trunks, never sync, never code `lands:` ticket: each needs user's yes → ticket stays out, named in plan. Blocker on other trunk → never stack across trunks: ticket waits (`#14 waits #9 on develop — needs sync`). Stale trunk → run anyway, drift named in report card.

## AFK mode — whole backlog, nobody back before the end

Arg says so (`afk`, `full afk`, "run the whole backlog"). Same pipeline, three limits lifted:

- **Stack depth unlimited.** Every ticket with an unlanded blocker stacks; never "waits for next run".
- **Multi-blocker → linearize.** Stack on the blocker branch that already contains every other open blocker (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`). None does → make one: the blocker not yet delivered stacks on the other at its own delivery (rebase its ticket range onto it, PR base = it). Result is mostly **one chain**, and merge order is forced bottom-up; say it in plan.
- **Code in parallel, deliver in chain order.** Tickets whose blockers are all in the current chain tip fork off that tip together, as one wave of up to 3. The wave rules still apply: no shared `REUSE`, and separate features or tabs. At delivery each sibling is stacked on the previous one (ticket-range rebase). Mechanical conflicts (nav slot, DI module lines, wiki sections) are resolved by the PM, followed by a rebuild and tests. A ticket that reuses what a sibling creates waits for that sibling instead.
- **Shared contract.** Two siblings that both need the same small helper (a use case or a repository method) get one contract up front: exact paths, names and signatures in both briefs. The first ticket in chain order owns it, and its version wins at the rebase.
- **Device lock.** Runtime checks serialize on a lock directory in the scratchpad: `until mkdir <lock>; do sleep 30; done` … `rmdir <lock>`. Every implementer brief names it.
- **Grill `todo` tickets unattended.** `/wa-grill` GitHub steps 1–4 (claim `grilling`, `gh issue develop`, spec, push), you answering each grill question with your own recommendation — read code + wiki first, YAGNI, most reversible option. Every such answer lands in `## Context / Decisions` tagged `(autopilot assumption)`, listed again in report card **To test** so user confirms or corrects. Grill needs product intent code can't give → don't guess: release `--reset-to todo --reason "BLOCKED: <question>"`, ticket stays out. Dependencies found → `wa-backlog depend`, then ticket enters plan like any `grilled` one.

Plan echo shows chain + leaves: `chain: #23 → #18 → #19 → #22 → #24 …` · `leaf ∥: #25 on #24`.

## 1. Plan the batch — what can run at once

Do `/wa-code` step 1 (**Plan**) for **every** task in batch, up front, main thread. Now hold one BRIEF per task — that tell you if two tasks share clock.

**GitHub provider:** `wa-backlog get <n>` → `blocked_by` with open blocker → ticket waits for that blocker's wave (or skip it: blocker not in batch and not landed = forks off code that isn't there).

**Stacking** — blocker in same batch, not landed: its wave delivers first, then dependent ticket **stacks on it**: worktree from ticket's own branch, `git rebase --onto origin/<blocker branch> $start^` (ticket range, **wa-board → Backlog provider**), `push --force-with-lease`, draft PR base = blocker branch. Only when blocker branch carries hooks v3+ (check above) — else no draft. One open blocker per stacked ticket: two unlanded blockers on different branches → can't stack, ticket waits for next run. Ask user max stack depth before planning (recommend 2: every feedback round on bottom ticket cascades one rebase per layer) — AFK mode: no limit, no question. Echo stack in plan: `wave 2 (∥): #17 · #20 · #26   ← stacked on #16`.
  - **Merge landing needs branch auto-delete.** GitHub retargets a stacked PR to the sprint only when its base branch is deleted on merge. Before the first stacked delivery check `gh api repos/{repo} --jq .delete_branch_on_merge`; false → `gh api -X PATCH repos/{repo} -F delete_branch_on_merge=true` (provision sets it) and say so. Without it each merge lands in the ticket below, not the sprint, and the chain's code never reaches base while tickets close. Recovery if it happened: one landing PR from chain tip onto the sprint, rebased from the first unlanded ticket's spec commit.
  - Stacked PR body says merge order: `Stacked on #<pr>: merge it first.`

**Two tasks independent when all hold:**
- `FILES` + `LAYOUT` sets don't intersect — no shared file, no shared target folder;
- neither's `REUSE` names something other creates;
- different features/modules (`BOUNDARIES` don't overlap).

Any doubt → **sequential**. Merge conflict at 3am cost more than wall-clock saved.

Group batch into **waves**: everything in wave runs parallel, waves run one after another. **Cap wave at 3** — beyond that, builds queue on machine anyway and report get unreadable.

Echo plan before start:

```
wave 1 (∥): login-apple · export-csv
wave 2     : sync-offline   (touches AuthStore, like login-apple)
```

## 2. Run a wave — one worktree per task

Each task get own checkout, so parallel implementers never see each other's edits.

1. **Create worktree** at `{worktrees}/<slug>` (**wa-board → Worktrees**: outside repo), always branching whatever `branch.per_task` says. Fork point per `/wa-code` step 0: `branch.base` (track task: its trunk, **wa-board → Tracks**), **or sprint branch** when task carry `sprint:` and `branch.sprint_prefix` non-empty — create `<branch.sprint_prefix><sprint>` from that once, before wave, then fork every task of that sprint off it.
   ```
   git worktree add {worktrees}/<slug> -b <branch.prefix><slug> <fork point>
   ```
   Task already has its branch (entered past `todo`, **Entry state**) → `git worktree add {worktrees}/<slug> <branch>`, no `-b`; listed worktree for it → reuse.
   **Sprint branch is created in the main checkout, never inside a worktree**, and only once per sprint per run — two waves of the same sprint share it. Tasks of one sprint in the *same* wave still fork off the sprint branch as it stood at wave start: they run in parallel, so none see each other. That's the wave planner's job to have made safe.
2. **Spawn one `wa-implementer` per task in the wave, in a single message** so they actually run concurrently. Each gets the standard `/wa-code` step 2 payload **plus its worktree path**, and the instruction: *work only under `<worktree>`, absolute paths, never touch the main checkout or another worktree.*
3. **Validate each task — autopilot runs `/wa-validate` itself.** Implementer receipt `done` + runtime check green (or build + tests on non-runnable project) → run **`/wa-validate` steps 3–8** for that task, unattended. The runtime check stands in for the user's green light: nobody there to give it, and the user asked autopilot to deliver reviewed code, not code waiting for a verifier.
   - **`validation`-stage tools** (`tools:`) run in that task's worktree before its verifier, per `/wa-validate` step 4.
   - **One `wa-verifier` per task**, per `/wa-code` step 3 in full. Scope = ticket range (GitHub provider) or `<trunk>..HEAD` of that worktree (`branch.base`, track task: its trunk) — hunks from that worktree only. Diff too big to inline → write it to a patch file in scratchpad, hand the path, tell it to read in ranges.
   - Verifiers are read-only → **parallelize freely** across tasks of the wave, no device queue.
   - `LENSES:` short of four ✓ → send back for missing lens before anything else.
   - **Autofix** (`review.autofix: true`) → `SendMessage` same task's implementer the findings, re-verify, cap 3 rounds. Autofix touched code → implementer re-drives runtime check (`verify.mode` not `off`), device queue again.
   - Clean → `phase:`/`status: validated`, `## Review` round `validation (autopilot)` with lenses + what autofix changed.
   - **Findings still open after cap** (or not converging) → not a blocker: deliver at `review`, open findings in `## Review` + report card with recommendation per item. User decides: `/wa-feedback` or `/wa-validate`.
   - `review.when` does not gate this — autopilot always validates.
4. **Keep every agent alive** — `agentId` per role **per task**. Autopilot is where this pays most: a batch of 5 tasks × 3 rounds is 15 spawns if you forget, 5 if you don't.

**The runtime check is on by default here** — `verify.mode: autopilot` (the default) means the implementer exercises what it just built — app, web page, service or CLI. Nobody is at the keyboard to catch a green build that doesn't work, so unattended is exactly where that proof is worth its cost. Only `verify.mode: off` skips it; `always` behaves the same as here. Non-runnable project (library, `verify.platform: none`, no device, no MCP server) → build + tests are the proof, say so in the report rather than claiming a check nobody ran.

**One device, one queue.** Builds run fine in parallel (separate worktrees, separate build dirs), but the **runtime check does not** — one simulator/emulator, one browser session, one local port. Serialize it: implementers in a wave build concurrently, then run their checks one at a time. Server/CLI checks that bind nothing shared may overlap. Tell each implementer to hold its runtime check until you say go, or accept that a wave's runtime checks are sequential tail work.

## 3. Close each task

1. **Commit in its worktree**, on its branch, with the configured author name/email. **Never as Claude. Never merge to base. Never touch another branch.** The commit is the delivery, not a close: code reviewed by the verifier but unseen by the user, sitting on a branch nobody merged.
2. **`status: validated`** (verifier clean) or **`review`** (findings open) + notes — never `done`. A task leaves autopilot waiting for the user to test it; clean one needs only their retest + `/wa-close`. **Never merge into the sprint branch here** — that's `/wa-close`, after the user tests; an unreviewed merge poisons the base of every later task in the sprint. **Validated → sync wiki in the delivery**: `/wa-wiki` update mode scoped to the task (its ticket-range diff + task file + `wiki:` pages), committed on the ticket branch before push — docs ride the ready PR, so **user tests then merges, no `/wa-close` needed**. Stacked chain → each ticket syncs on top of the one below, never conflicting. Findings open → skip, `/wa-close` does it after `/wa-validate`.
3. **Remove the worktree** (`git worktree remove {worktrees}/<slug>`) — the branch survives, that's what the user tests later. A blocked task keeps its worktree; say so in the report.

Skip the report-and-iterate phase entirely — nobody's there to iterate with. Save the report to `{reports}/<slug>.md` (`{…}` from the config's `paths:` block, see **wa-board → Paths**) — **in the main checkout, never inside a worktree**: the worktree gets removed and the report with it.

## Blockers — skip and log, never ask, never guess

The "stop and ask" rule is inverted here: nobody is watching. A `BLOCKED:` from the implementer, a failed runtime check, or any ambiguity →

- set the task `status: todo` with a `blocked` note, write the open question into the task file;
- **move to the next task.** Never guess scope, never invent a feature, never commit an unverified one as done.

A blocker in one task **does not** stall its wave — the others keep going.

## Final report

Print and save `{reports}/autopilot-<date>.md`:

```
# Autopilot · 2026-09-18 · 🏁 login-refacto 2/3

2 · 🟢 **Login Apple** — to test · review clean
3 · 🟡 **Login layout** — to test · 2 findings open
5 · 🟢 **Forgot password** — ⛔ blocked

---
## 🟢 Login Apple · branch wa/login-apple
<report card>

## 🟡 Login layout · branch wa/login-layout
<report card>

---
## ⛔ Forgot password
Question: reset by email or magic link?
Rec: magic link, already in place for signup.

→ next: test login-apple, then `/wa-close login-apple`
```

Three parts, always this order:

1. **Recap** — every task of the batch, **wa-board list format** (line 1 only), suffix `— to test · review clean`, `— to test · <n> findings open` or `— ⛔ blocked`. Sprint in play → progress line in title; several sprints → group recap by sprint.
2. **One card per delivered task** — **wa-code → Report card**, branch in header instead of sprint tag. Same skeleton as attended `/wa-code`.
3. **Blocked** — per task: open question + your recommended answer, one line each. Kept worktree → say so.

One branch per task still, never one per sprint: user reviews and merges task by task. Never write `review: clean` for a task the verifier never saw or with findings open.

## Next step

Test the delivered branches — already reviewed by the verifier. Notes on one → **`/wa-feedback <slug> <notes>`** (checks it out, applies them through the same pipeline; task back to `review`, needs `/wa-validate` again). Matches spec → **merge the ready PR** (GitHub provider; wiki already synced, hook sets `done`), or **`/wa-close <slug>`** on the local provider — it merges into the sprint branch or lands per `close.strategy`. Delivered with findings open → `/wa-feedback` or `/wa-validate` first.
