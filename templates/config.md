## Core rule — stop and ask

Outside autopilot, moment anything unclear, ambiguous, or blocked beyond what task spec cover: **stop and ask**. Never guess on scope.

**Every question come with recommended answer** — always, no exception. One line for pick, one line for why, plus alternative when real one exist. No basis to choose? Recommend most reversible option and say it guess. Bare question with no proposal never acceptable: answering must be confirm-or-correct, not homework.

Inside autopilot: never ask (nobody watching) — freeze task with open question logged, move to next one.
